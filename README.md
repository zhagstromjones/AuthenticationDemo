# AuthenticationDemo
A simple demonstration of authentication using RCAB principles.

This simple application demonstrates the Confidentiality aspect of the CIA triad. When a user logs in and their username and password (omitted to simplify this demonstration) have both been authenticated, the login() function takes the username as an argument and automatically authorizes application functionality based upon the role of the user.
